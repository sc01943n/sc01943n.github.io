          <h1>About GrowNYC</h1>
          <p>
            GrowNYC was originally created in 1970 as the Council on the Environment of New York City (CENYC). 
          </p>
          <dl>

            <h3>Today</h3>
            <dd>
              GrowNYC is a leading 501(3)(c) environmental nonprofit in NYC - helping more than 3 million New Yorkers by providing essential sustainability services and taking action to make NYC a truly livable city. One where every New Yorker can enjoy a healthier, more sustainable life. Our mission is to empower all New Yorkers with equitable access to fresh, locally grown food, neighborhood green spaces, opportunities to reduce waste, and care for the environment.
           </dd>

            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <dd>
              We envision a New York City where fresh, nutritious food is ensured as a basic human right. Where our foodshed is protected and local farmers prosper. Where all have access to places to gather and grow. Where we handle our waste responsibly. And where all New Yorkers, especially those with <b>frontline identities*</b>, are empowered to enact their vision of a thriving community.
            </dd>
            <dd>*“Frontline identities” includes but is not limited to BIPOC, queer, those with disabilities, and new immigrants
            </dd>

          <p>
            Since 2007, GrowNYC has operated zero waste programs funded by the NYC Department of Sanitation, educating tens of thousands of city residents and property owners about conservation and providing hands-on resources any New Yorker can participate in like composting, clothing collections, free reuse events, and more. Our zero waste programs include:
          </p>
          <ul class="tablet-desktop">
            <li>Food scrap drop-off sites</li>
            <li>Clothing collections</li>
            <li>Free reuse events</li>
          </ul>

          <img

          <p>
            Since 1976, GrowNYC Greenmarket has promoted regional agriculture and ensured a continuing supply of fresh, local produce for all New Yorkers. Greenmarkets supports farmers and preserves farmland for the future by providing regional farmers with opportunities to sell their fruits, vegetables and other products at our open-air farmers markets throughout New York City.
          </p>
<p>
            GrowNYC Greenmarkets are producer-only markets with rigorous “grow-your-own” standards. Why is that important? Because selling directly to customers means farmers, fishers and their children can keep doing what they love and feeding growing cities. It also means you get to know who grows your food. Our food and agriculture initiatives include:
          </p>
          <ul class="tablet-desktop">
            <li>GrowNYC farmers markets</li>
            <li>GrowNYC Wholesale</li>
            <li>Farm beginnings courses</li>
